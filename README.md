# JavaPointCloud
Java Point Cloud is an open project for point cloud processing.

## Instalation 
Jpc needs libraries to work. Being entirely java-encoded, the easiest way to install it is to use MAVEN. To do so, install MAVEN by following the instructions given [here](https://maven.apache.org/install.html).

Then clone or download the source code, go to the directory where the "pom.xml" file is located and execute the following command in a terminal: 
```
mvn install
```
